# customStickerApp
This is an example of customized sticker pack for iMessage. 
Sticker browser is implemented as UICollectionViewController with a custom layout. 
This project can be used as a starter kit for creating new iMessage app. You can change only assets and background colors, or you can do something more advanced and change how the layout is organized.
